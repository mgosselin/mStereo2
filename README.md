mStereo2
========

mStereo is a two-channel digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for audio. Its design is public-domain.  It is a small part of an eventual comprehensive hardware solution for playback of digital audio files stored on computers and mobile devices. It is currently on revision 2.  Revision 1 is superceeded by revision 2, and while conceptually similar the hardware have little overlap.  Thus revision 1 documenation will no longer be updated and will remain accessible only by request.
