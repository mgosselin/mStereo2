Schematic:
1) add voltage test-points for all power and ground planes to schematic so they get into the netlist
2) add 10 uF electrolytic decoupling caps on SRC4192 in accordance with burr-brown application recommendation
3) major overhaul of power supply architecture (move all of it onto main PCB, incl. transformers)
4) add jumpers to optionally disconnect power supplies
5) add jumpers onto ENABLE pins of LDO's
6) ensure one power LED included for all power lines and/or power planes
7) accommodate AMB zeta 1 plus support components mounted up against rear panel
8) add pin-headers for wiring a panel-mount LED assembly (support an IDC ribbon connector)
9) separate supply LDOs for clock oscillator and clock distrubutor
10) allow breakout for i2s bus after reclocking
11) allow breakout for clock oscillator output
12) allow breakout for analog before LPF
13) allow breakout for analog before XLR output connectors
14) allow disconnect of i2c arriving at DACs
15) allow disconnect of analog arriving at LPF
16) allow disconnect of analog arriving at XLR output connectors
17) add series resistors on bus lines for anti-reflection (47Î©)
18) add provisions for installing seclectable ground loop breaker vs. direct connection to chassis via one of the mounting holes
19) use AND gates to gather PCM status pins from ICs --> output resulting state to a single bicolor LED (green/red toggle)
20) add provisions for output enable/disable at power up/down (based on OPA1632 EN pin or relay-based)
21) add M3 chassis-mount holes to schematic
22) accommodate an off-board (probably chassis-mount) AC mains power switch

Footprints:
1) update OPA1632 MSOP-8 footprint with better thermal releif
2) accommodate different clock footprints
3) accommodate AMB zeta 1
4) lengthen the pads (outward) on the TSSOP-28 footprint by ~ 0.5 - 1.0 mm to aid assembly
5) make all text sizes the same
6) pick an IEC entry module which can directly PCB mount

Layout:
1) accommodate AMB zeta 1
2) increase the text size for labels on LED indicators
3) add a "PCM only" notice on the USB->i2s converter module
4) make more "empty space" around bank of LED indicators
5) move the LED "indicator bank" along the "front" edge of the PCB (WRT chassis)
