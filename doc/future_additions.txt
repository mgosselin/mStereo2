Schematic:
1) add voltage test-points for all power and ground planes to schematic so they get into the netlist
2) add 10 uF electrolytic decoupling caps on SRC4192 in accordance with burr-brown application recommendation
3) separate +5VDC supply for DAC analog pins into L and R
4) derive a +5VDC supply from the +12VDC analog supply rail
5) accommodate AMB zeta 1
6) add lightpipes or pin-headers for wiring a panel-mount LED assembly
7) ferrites for supply isolation between clock and clock buffer
8) add breakout header(s) for i2s bus before and after reclocking
9) add breakout header(s) for analog before and after LPF
10) add on-board connectors so that chassis/panel-mount XLR connectors may also be used
11) add jumpers to optionally disconnect buffer stage
12) add series resistors on bus lines for anti-reflection
13) add a second set of power connectors on the other side of the PCB
14) ensure one power LED included for all power lines and/or power planes

Footprints:
1) update OPA1632 footprint with better thermal releif
2) accommodate different clock footprints
3) accommodate AMB zeta 1
4) change the output connector footprint to accept XLR connectors with a separate ground pin (i.e. NC3MAAH)
5) lengthen the pads (outward) on the TSSOP-28 footprint by ~ 0.5 - 1.0 mm to aid manual assembly

Layout:
1) accommodate AMB zeta 1
2) make a mini "local" power plane for the clock and clock buffer power
3) move mounting holes so they are at least 1cm from front/back edges of PCB for easier mounting
