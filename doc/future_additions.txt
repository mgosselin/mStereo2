1) add voltage test-points for all power and ground planes to schematic so they get into the netlist
2) add 10 uF electrolytic decoupling caps on SRC4192 in accordance with burr-brown application recommendation
3) update OPA1632 footprint with better thermal releif
4) introduce a mute function (use OPA1632 'enable' pins for this ??)
5) add output coupling transformers
6) separate +5VDC supply for DAC analog pins into L and R
7) accommodate different clock footprints
8) accommodate AMB zeta 1
9) ferrites for supply isolation between clock and clock buffer
10) add lightpipes or a pin-headers for wiring a panel-mount LED assembly
11) add breakout header(s) for i2s bus before and after reclocking
12) add breakout header(s) for analog before and after LPF
13) add on-board connectors so that chassis/panel-mount XLR connectors may also be used
14) add jumpers to optionally disconnect analog stage
