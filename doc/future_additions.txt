Schematic:
1) add voltage test-points for all power and ground planes to schematic so they get into the netlist
2) add 10 uF electrolytic decoupling caps on SRC4192 in accordance with burr-brown application recommendation
3) major overhaul of power supply architecture (move all of it onto main PCB, incl. transformers)
4) ensure one power LED included for all power lines and/or power planes
5) accommodate AMB zeta 1 plus support components
6) add pin-headers for wiring a panel-mount LED assembly (support an IDC ribbon connector)
7) separate supply LDOs for clock oscillator and clock distrubutor
8) add breakout header(s) for i2s bus before reclocking
9) add breakout header(s) for i2s bus after reclocking
10) add breakout header at clock oscillator output
11) add breakout header(s) for analog before and after LPF
12) change from board-mount XLR connectors to air-wired XLR connectors
13) add series resistors on bus lines for anti-reflection (47Î©)
14) add provisions for installing seclectable ground loop breaker vs. direct connection to chassis via one of the mounting holes
15) use AND gates to gather PCM status pins from ICs --> output resulting state to a single bicolor LED (gree/red toggle)
16) add provisions for output enable/disable at power up/down (based on OPA1632 EN pin or relay-based)
17) add M3 chassis-mount holes to schematic
`
Footprints:
1) update OPA1632 MSOP-8 footprint with better thermal releif
2) accommodate different clock footprints
3) accommodate AMB zeta 1
4) lengthen the pads (outward) on the TSSOP-28 footprint by ~ 0.5 - 1.0 mm to aid assembly
5) make all text sizes the same

Layout:
1) accommodate AMB zeta 1
2) increase the text size for labels on LED indicators
3) add a "PCM only" notice on the USB->i2s converter module
4) make more "empty space" around bank of LED indicators
5) move the LED "indicator bank" along the "front" edge of the PCB (WRT chassis)
