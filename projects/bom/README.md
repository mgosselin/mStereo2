## BOM Notes

[The Acutal BOM](https://github.com/mgosselin/mStereo2/blob/master/projects/bom/mStereo2.csv) is best viewed in .CSV on a separate page.  Most vendors provide "BOM-upload tools" that prefer .CSV format.

#### 1. Circuit Board Support-Components
The listed items are for populating the circuit board only.  Additional recommended hardware is as follows:
  
  1. A plastic insulation sheet to isolate the exposed pins on the bottom of the board from the chassis beneath (if a metal chassis is being used and the PCB will be mounted less than 5mm from the chassis panel beneth it).
  2. Standoffs
  3. Machine screws
  4. Hookup wire
  5. Heat shrink tubing

#### 2. Power supplies

#### 3. Vendor Recommendations

#### 4. Output Filter / Buffer Design Considerations

#### 5. Amanero Combo 384
 1. An Amanero Combo 384 module [(webpage)](http://www.amanero.com/)
 2. USB Cable, such as: 
 3. A USB panel mount jack, such as:

#### 6. Enclosures
  1. Hammond 1445T2201 (PCB geometry and connector positioning fits this case perfectly without power supply)
  2. 1U standard rack-mount enclosures, such as:
  3. Custom enclosures

#### 7. Alternative XLR analog output connectors
Discussed in depth in Wiring and Ground.  The default connector is Neutrik [NC3MAAH-1](http://www.neutrik.com/en/xlr/aa-series/nc3maah-1).
